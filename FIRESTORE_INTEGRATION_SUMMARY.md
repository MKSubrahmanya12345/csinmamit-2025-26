# Firestore Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Profile Hook Implementation**
- Created a new `useProfileFirestore.js` hook that properly integrates with Firebase Firestore
- The hook now correctly reads and writes user profile data to Firestore

### 2. **Data Structure Alignment**
- Aligned the data structure with Firestore security rules
- The hook now saves data in the format expected by the Firestore rules:
  - Top-level fields: `name`, `bio`, `branch`, `usn`, `github`, `linkedin`, `phone`
  - Nested `profile` object for backward compatibility
  - Proper timestamps using `serverTimestamp()`

### 3. **Component Updates**
- Fixed the `Profile-new.jsx` to properly import and use the Firestore hook
- Updated `ProfileForm.jsx` to include additional fields (USN, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- Fixed icon import issue (replaced non-existent `IdCard` with `CreditCard`)

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Profile Data Sync**
   - Automatically fetches user profile from Firestore on component mount
   - Updates local state when Firestore data changes

2. **Profile Editing**
   - Edit mode toggle functionality
   - Save changes to Firestore with proper validation
   - Cancel editing with data restoration

3. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Permission denied handling
   - Service unavailability handling

4. **Security Rules Compliance**
   - Data structure matches Firestore security rules
   - Only allowed fields are updated
   - Proper field validation (USN format, phone format, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **src/hooks/useProfileFirestore.js** (Created)
   - Complete Firestore integration for profile management

2. **src/pages/Profile-new.jsx** (Updated)
   - Properly imports and uses the Firestore hook
   - Handles loading and authentication states

3. **src/components/Profile/ProfileForm.jsx** (Updated)
   - Added new fields (USN, GitHub, LinkedIn)
   - Fixed icon imports

## Testing Instructions

1. **Sign In Required**
   - The profile page requires authentication
   - Users must sign in with Google to access their profile

2. **Profile Operations**
   - Click "Edit Profile" to enable editing mode
   - Modify fields as needed
   - Click "Save" to persist changes to Firestore
   - Click "Cancel" to discard changes

3. **Firestore Rules**
   - Users can only read/write their own profile
   - Field validation is enforced by security rules
   - Only specific fields can be updated

## Environment Requirements

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Ensure Firebase environment variables are set in `.env`
   - Firebase project must have Firestore enabled
   - Authentication with Google provider must be configured

2. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - The current rules allow users to:
     - Read their own profile
     - Create their profile with valid data
     - Update allowed fields only
     - Delete their own profile

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - Profile page is only accessible to authenticated users
   - Redirects to home page if not authenticated

2. **Field Restrictions**
   - Email and College fields are read-only
   - Role field cannot be changed by users

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test with actual Firebase credentials
   - Verify data persistence in Firestore console
   - Test error scenarios

2. **Enhancements**
   - Add profile picture upload functionality
   - Implement certificate management
   - Add profile completion percentage
   - Add data validation on the frontend

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Firebase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Ensure these environment variables are set:
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   ```

2. **Verify Firestore Rules**
   - Check that the security rules in `firestore.rules` are deployed
   - Ensure the user document structure matches the rules

3. **Console Errors**
   - Check browser console for specific error messages
   - Look for permission denied errors
   - Check network tab for failed Firestore requests

## Success Indicators

When working correctly:
- User can sign in with Google
- Profile data loads from Firestore
- Edit mode allows field modification
- Save successfully updates Firestore
- Toast notifications show success/error messages
- Data persists across page refreshes
